### MVP: Minimal Viable Product

An API call should spin up the approrpiate amount of GPU compute for the single call and return an image, or a pointer to an image in S3.

You should be able to query the available models that are available (stored in S3) and include that in the API call.

## Clouds
These DUCKS should be able to fly in any cloud. We'll start with [CoreWeave](https://www.coreweave.com).


We've only ever flown in AWS so for now, this is the "North Star" to guide the flight. New diagram to come.
